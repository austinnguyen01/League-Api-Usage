This code is supposed to be used as a demo not a final product. The new rune system has now changed the way you need to get people to confirm their account. To do so you need a tournament id which I do not have therefore this project will be paused until I can get a tournament api code. The code is also not very clean if someone can clean it up it would be much appericated.
