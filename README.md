# League Api Usage

This code is supposed to be used as a demo not a final product. The new rune system has now changed the way you need to get people to confirm their account. To do so you need a tournament id which I do not have therefore this project will be paused until I can get a tournament api code. The code is also not very clean if someone can clean it up it would be much appericated.

#!!!! github added <<<<<<< HEAD and some other random tags to some of the php files breaking them make sure you remove them when you find them
